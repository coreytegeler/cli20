/*
1. Only add new content inside of the section tag
	 with your name as the ID

2. Only add styles to the elements you've created

3. Start every CSS selector with #yourname
	 so it doesn't conflict with other people's work
	 Examples: #yourname .class, #yourname #id

3. Do not use position: fixed, use absolute instead.

4. Do not edit donotedit.css
